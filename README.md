elive-tools
===========

Set of handy and useful tools by Elive, for specially use in the Elive project

This is a brief summary of tools and features:

* audio-configurator
It let's you to configure and use a specific alsa card (yes, really!)

* bkp
One of the most AMAZING tools ever made, extremely handy, it saves "states" of your actual working directories, being able to recover them, to make a diff, or to visualize differences and merge them, it even creates a separated working dir if you want to run "make" or doing massive changes just for test. Yeah, its similar to what can git do, but the main goal of this tool is:
  * idependent
  * fast
  * handy

* elivepaste
A small tool for use pastebin's and send the link to the elive channels

* waitfor
It waits on the shell for a process that terminates and exits, its pretty useful for do things like:
$ waitfor rebuild-packages && rebuild-iso

(it waits for that the process rebuilding packages finishes before to run the process to rebuild the iso)

* user-manager
The tool to create users in Elive, it is meant to include all the user-creation features

* make-cookies-with-chocolate
A tool for make delicious cookies
Well, im joking, of course, but you can push it :)
